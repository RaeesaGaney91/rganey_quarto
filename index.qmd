::: {#hero-heading}

Raeesa Ganey is a Lecturer in the School of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of the Witwatersrand, where she has been teaching since October 2015.

I began my academic journey at North-West University, earning a BSc in Actuarial Science, and later moved to the University of Cape Town to complete my BCom Honours, MSc, and PhD in Statistics. I currently teach second-year Mathematical Statistics and third-year Multivariate Data Analysis.

My research centers on multivariate data visualisation, with a particular focus on biplots — developing both theoretical extensions and practical tools in `R` for high-dimensional and dynamic data.

I'm an active member of the Centre for Multi-Dimensional Data Visualisation (MuViSU), the South African Statistical Association (SASA), and the Multivariate Data Analysis Group (MDAG) within SASA.

Outside of academia, I share life’s chaos and joy with my husband Zain, our two wonderful children — and baby number three, expected in October 2025!
